**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Button Visibility:**  
   - "Add to Cart" button should be visible on the homepage, product list, and product detail pages.

2. **Product Addition:**  
   - Users must be able to successfully add a product to the cart by clicking the button on any page.

3. **Valid Quantities:**  
   - The system should accept valid quantities (e.g., 1, 10, 50) and successfully add products to the cart.

4. **Invalid Quantities:**  
   - Invalid quantities (e.g., negative, decimal, zero, or text) should be rejected, and an error message should appear.

5. **Excessive Quantity Limit:**  
   - Users should not be able to add excessively large quantities (e.g., 100,000), with an error message for exceeding the limit.

**Non-Functional Requirements:**

1. **Performance:**  
   - The "Add to Cart" functionality should be quick and responsive.

2. **Cross-Browser Compatibility:**  
   - The feature should work seamlessly on major browsers like Chrome and Firefox.

3. **Usability:**  
   - Buttons should be easy to find, and error messages should be clear.

4. **Security:**  
   - Proper validation should prevent invalid or malicious data entry.

**Testing Strategy:**

- Verify button visibility on different pages.
- Test successful product addition from various pages.
- Test valid and invalid quantity inputs.
- Ensure the system rejects excessive quantities.

**Edge Cases:**
- Handle cases with already added products, extreme quantity values, or network failures.

This analysis ensures the "Add to Cart" feature works seamlessly and efficiently, providing a smooth user experience.
